	            <p>
	    	        Is it true that dating is a complicated game for many men and women? It might be something that they can never understand. However, it is actually not as difficult as it seems.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        I have five friends; Star, Vivian, Caria, Bony, and Jane. Star was chased by most of the girls in our High School. Vivian was one of those popular girls-hard working, cheerful, stylish, and sexy. Jane ana Caria were also beautiful and hard working. Jane was one of those beautiful and average looking girls. Caria was also beautiful and hard working. Bony was a rascal, he laughed a lot. Vivian and Jane were both totally crazy about Star.
	            </p> 

	            <p>
	    	        Vivian didn't have to do anything to attract Star, because she was already attractive to everybody. Jana on the other hand, showered Star with love;she loved and care for him. Jane respected herself and anyone she loved. In fact, she looked sweet and pleasant. But she wasn't a group leader, she did not like wearing 'show your back', 'show your thigh', 'show your breasts', king of clothes. Everyone expected Star to choose Vivian the most beautiful and hottest girl. Do not forget, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Caria was just an ordinary and plain girl. Caria was labelled as the cool and attractive type. Star always insulted Jane, telling her what a 'plain' Jane she was and how shy she looked.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        This obviously made Jane feel so hurt and useless. That's life. Jane never gave up though. She wanted to prove something to Star. She wanted to prove that looks weren't everything. She studied hard, really hard. She became the top girl, and all the boys who once ignored her, chased her again. But she never forgot Star. She put a red rose in Star's locker every day. Always with the same words,<em> 'I care for you and will alwys do'</em>, because she knew that Star was facing a hard time despite Vivian's presence.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Star began to realise how stupid he had been to choose Vivian as a girlfriend. His beloved girlfriend Vivian was flirting with other men. Vivian broke up with Star later.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Because she found wealthier man. Star felt so cheated, stupid, and foolish.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        He went to look for Jane. He knelt on his knees, and said, 'Jane, please forgive me. Do you want to be my girlfriend?' Jane rejected him outright, much to everybody's surprise. She only uttered these words, 'you've suffered a great loss, so i don't want you to face another one'. Star regretted for choosing the wrong girl.
	    	    </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Star felt disappointed. He didn't understand a word that she said to him but eventually they became good friends and did everything togerther. Star was relieved and gradually improved academically. Because Jane made him to have the type of love he never experienced before. His ex-girlfriends had never treated him that way. They just accepted him for his looks. But Jane accepted him wholeheartedly. She changed him gradually and he did well in all his examinations. Jane continued putting a red rose into his locker everyday with the same words <em>'I care for you and will always do'</em>.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        One day, Jane didn't turn up in school. Everybody was amazed because it was unusual ofmher. She didn't come for two weeks. At first, Star thought she went on a holiday trip with her family because she told him that she would be going to Japan with them. But one day, he received a call from the General Hospital saying that Jane was about to die. She had been suffering from severe cancer.
	    	    </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Jane never informed Star about it because she didn't want him to worry about her and fail his exams. Now that she was about to die, she wanted to see Star for the last time.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Star rushed to the hospital. When he saw how weak Jane was, tears began rolling down his cheecks. He whispered, whispered, and whispered. 'Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why did you hide this from me?'
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        She looked at him, smiled weakly and lovely at him and said,<strong>'Do not worry. Your maker will take good care of you. I am going to where my soul is needed, you cannot go with me. When i said that i didn't want you to suffer from facing another loss, i meant this. I didn't want to tell you because i didn't want to worry you. I wanted to spend my last days with you cheerfully'.</strong>
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Star looked at her surprisingly. <em>'You can't leave me!' he said. 'How will i be without you? I cannot believe it! It is not me! I cannot imagine it! Where will you put me, who will care for me?'</em>
	    	    </p>

	            <p>
	    	        <strong>'You'll be who you are now. I will always be there by your side. Never forget that i still love you. Cherish those times. LIve life happily with whoe-ver comes next. And one more thing. Yes, I love you indeed! I love you'</strong>.And she died. Star screamed loudely. He still couldn't accept Jane's death. He had only spent a month with Jane. A month? Yes, but Jane changed his life to a better level before she died-a situation no one could ever explain. He deeply regretted for Jane's death.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        He knew that Jane would always be keeping an eye on him from wherever she found herself in the spiritual world. Sometimes we just don't appreciate those people who really care for us. Until they leave us, until we lose them, until they are no more, until something unexpected happens to us then we regret for losing them. Such is life anyway....Life is unpredictable. Outer beauty doesn't matter; it's the character that count most. It's better to tell someone how much you love and care for him/her than to keep quite over it and lose the person. You'll regret it or remember him/her later when help is needed and no one is there to help!
	    	    </p>

	            <p>
	    	        Love is simple but a bit complicated. When we went through difficulties to achieve our aim as lover's Jane left me behind last minute. She is gone and gone forever.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	    	        But i know she is with me all the time, out if sight is never out of mind. Star advised his friends to choose friends who can help and improve their lives. It is a two way offer. You can also improve somebodey's life, somebody can also improve your life. Due to the experiences Star went through, he was able to say, 'I love you, in many languages' you can think of.
